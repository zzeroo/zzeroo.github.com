Testing a patch

Sometimes a developer might ask you to test a quick patch he came up with.
Below an example how to do that for modemmanager. If your bug is for some
other package, just replace the package name

# get build dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential fakeroot devscripts
sudo apt-get build-dep modemmanager

# get sources
sudo apt-get source modemmanager

# cd into the source directory
cd modemmanager-*/

# apply the patch (note that -p1 could also be -p0 if the patch was created
# without an extra prefix in the diff path)
patch -p1 < /tmp/yourdownloadedpatch.diff

# build binaries only without signing
debuild -b -uc

# packages are produced in parent directory
cd ../

# install all nm packages
sudo dpkg -i modemmanager*.deb

Note that you didnt change the version of the package. so to get back to the
"official" current version you need to do something like:

  sudo apt-get install --reinstall modemmanager

  if you installed other packages from the build, do the same for them.
